In order to change the text of "About me" block, go to the theme's option page ("Manage" => "Theme options").

In addition you might want to change the face above. I prepared a background without a face which rests in images/photo-bg.png. Put your own face on it, name as photo.png, move to images/photo.png and your face would show up on your blog.
